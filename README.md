# Simple Arithmetic over Client-Server

## Introduction
This exercise is presenting client server system for basic arithmetic calculations

### Functionality
- Client:
    The class should have a method to get two numbers and an arithmetic
    operation from the user (interactively).
    Sends these numbers and operation to Server.
- Server:
    Receives the numbers from Client.
    Perform the operation of the given numbers
    Returns the result back to Client.
    Advantage - implement the mathematical operation as concrete implantation
    of an abstract class
- Client:
    print the result.

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Setup and Execution
1. Install Python3 if not already installed.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_URL>
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/project
    ```
4. Run the server side first:
    ```bash
    python3 server_base_class.py
    ```
5. Run the client side:
    ```bash
    python3 client_base_class.py
    ```
6. Log files (cliebt.log and server.log will be created upon first execution)
